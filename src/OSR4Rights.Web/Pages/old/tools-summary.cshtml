<h2>Face Search</h2>

<p>Looks for a target face which you give as an image, in many other images. </p>

<p>This is designed as a first pass to help human rights investigators - let this tool process many images and narrow down the most likely ones for investigators to look at</p>

<p>Here is a sample output</p>

<h2>Hate Speech</h2>

<p>We define "hate speech" as text that contains hateful, offensive and toxic language. The tool will produce a score (between 0 and 100) indicative of the extent of hate speech contained in the input text. The languages currently supported by this tool are English, Arabic and Russian, although the language does not need to be specified together with the input text. </p>
